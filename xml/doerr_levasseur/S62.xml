<introduction>
<p>In this section we introduce directed graphs as a way to visualize relations on a set. </p>
</introduction>
<subsection><title>Digraphs</title>
<p>Let \(A = \{0, 1,2,3\}\), and let  \[r = \{(0, 0), (0, 3), (1, 2), (2, 1), (3, 2), (2, 0)\}\]
In representing this relation as a graph, elements of <m>A</m> are called the vertices of the graph. They are typically represented by labeled points or small circles. We connect vertex <m>a</m> to vertex <m>b</m> with an arrow, called an edge, going from vertex <m>a</m> to vertex <m>b</m> if and only if \(a r b\).  This type of graph of a relation <m>r</m> is called a <term>directed graph</term> or <term>digraph</term>. <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-1" text="type-global" /> is a digraph for <m>r</m>. Notice that since 0 is related to itself, we draw a <q>self-loop</q> at 0.<idx>Directed graph</idx><idx>Digraph</idx></p>

<p>The actual location of the vertices in a digraph is immaterial. The actual location of vertices we choose is called an <term>embedding of a graph</term><idx>Embedding of a graph</idx>. The main idea is to place the vertices in such a way that the graph is easy to read. After drawing a rough-draft graph of a relation, we may decide to relocate the vertices so that the final result will be neater. <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-1" text="type-global" /> could also
be presented as in <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-2" text="type-global" />.</p>

<p>A vertex of a graph is also called a node, point, or a junction. An edge of a graph is also referred to as an arc, a line, or a branch. Do not be concerned if two graphs of a given relation look different as long as the connections between vertices are the same in two graphs.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-another-simple-graph"><title>Another directed graph</title><p>Consider the relation <m>s</m> whose digraph is <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-3" text="type-global" />. What information does this give us? The graph tells us that <m>s</m> is a relation on \(A = \{1, 2, 3\}\) and that \(s = \{(1, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 1), (2, 3), (3, 3)\}\).</p>

						<sageplot>
                  g=DiGraph({1:[2,3],2:[1,3],3:[1,3]})
                  f623=g.plot(layout="circular",loop_size=0.1)
                  f623
                  </sageplot>
            </image>
      </figure>
</example>
<p>We will be building on the next example in the following section.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-subsets-2-ordering"><title>Ordering subsets of a two element universe</title><p> Let \(B = \{1,2\}\), and let \(A = \mathcal{P}(B) = \{\emptyset, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{1,2\}\}\). Then \(\subseteq\) is a relation on <m>A</m> whose digraph is <xref ref="fig-graph-6-2-subsets-2" text="type-global" />.</p>
<figure xml:id="fig-graph-6-2-subsets-2">
   <caption>Graph for set containment on subsets of <m>\{1,2\}</m> </caption>

   <description>Graph for set containment on subsets  of <m>\{1,2\}</m></description>
   </image>
</figure>
<p>We will see in the next section that since \(\subseteq\) has certain structural properties that describe <q>partial orderings.</q> We will be able to draw a much simpler type graph than this one, but for now the graph above serves our purposes.</p>
