<introduction><p>This is a stub for Part 2 of Applied Discrete Stuctures. To see the whole chapter, visit our web page at http://faculty.uml.edu/klevasseur/ADS2.</p><p>An essential tool that anyone interested in computer science must master is how to think recursively. The ability to understand definitions, concepts,
algorithms, etc., that are presented recursively and the ability to put thoughts into a recursive framework are essential in computer science. One of our goals in this chapter is to help the reader become more comfortable with recursion in its commonly encountered forms.</p>
<p>A second goal is to discuss recurrence relations. We will concentrate on methods of solving recurrence relations, including an introduction to generating
functions.

<statement>
<p>
<ol label="(a)">
<li><p>Write out the characteristic equation of the relation \(S(k) + C_1S(k - 1) +\ldots + C_n S(k - n) =0\), which is \(a^n+ C_1a^{n-1}+\cdots
+C_{n-1}a+C_n=0\).</p></li>
<li><p>Find all roots of the characteristic equation, the characteristic roots.</p></li>
<li><p> If there are <m>n</m> distinct characteristic roots, \(a_1, a_2, \dots a_n\), then the general solution of the recurrence relation
is \(S(k) = b_1a_1{}^k+ b_2a_2{}^k+\cdots +b_na_n{}^k\). If there are fewer than <m>n</m> characteristic roots, then at least one root is a multiple
root. If \(a_j\) is a double root, then the \(b_ja_j{}^k\) term is replaced with \(\left(b_{j 0}+b_{j 1}k\right)a_j^{k}\textrm{.}\) In general, if \(a_j\) is a root of multiplicity <m>p</m>, then the \(b_ja_j{}^k\) term is replaced with \(\left(b_{j 0}+b_{j 1}k+\cdots +b_{j(p-1)}k^{p-1}\right)a_j^{k}\).</p></li>
<li><p>If <m>n</m> initial conditions are given, we get <m>n</m> linear equations in <m>n</m> unknowns (the \({b_j}'s\) from Step 3) by substitution. If possible, solve these equations to determine a final form for \(S(k)\).</p></li>

<example xml:id="ex-hrr-solution-example-2"><title>Solution of a Third Order Recurrence Relation</title><p> Solve \(S(k) - 7S(k - 2) + 6S(k - 3) = 0\), where \(S(0) =8\), \(S(1) = 6\), and \(S(2) = 22\).</p><p><ol label="(a)">
<li><p> The characteristic equation is \(a^3 - 7a + 6 = 0\).</p></li>
<li><p>The only rational roots that we can attempt are \(\pm  1, \pm 2, \pm 3, \textrm{and} \pm 6\). By checking these, we obtain the three roots 1,
2, and \(-3\).</p></li>
<li><p>The general solution is \(S(k) =b_11^k+b_22^k+b_3(-3){}^k\). The first term can simply be written \(b_1\) .

</p></li>
<li><p>\(\left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 S(0)=8 \\
 S(1)=6 \\
 S(2)=22 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\textrm{   }\Rightarrow \left\{
\begin{array}{c}
 b_1+b_2+b_3=8 \\
 b_1+2b_2-3b_3=6 \\
 b_1+4b_2+9b_3=22 \\
\end{array}
\right\}\textrm{  }\)

You can solve this system by elimination to obtain \(b_1=5\), \(b_2=2\), and \(b_3=1\). Therefore,

<m>\quad</m>\(S(k) = 5 + 2\cdot 2^k + (-3)^k = 5 + 2^{k+1} + (-3)^k\)
