<introduction><p>Our goal in this section is to answer an open question from earlier in this chapter and introduce a related concept. The question is: When are left cosets of a subgroup a group
under the induced operation? This question is open for non-abelian groups. Now that we have some examples to work with, we can try a few experiments.</p></introduction>

<example xml:id="ex-alternating-cosets"><title>Cosets of \(A_3\)</title><p>We have seen that \(A_3= \left\{i,r_1,r_2\right\}\) is a subgroup of \(S_3\), and its left cosets are \(A_3\) itself and \(B_3=\left\{f_1,f_2,f_3\right\}\). Whether \(\left\{A_3 , B_3 \right\}\) is a group boils down to determining whether the induced operation is well defined.   Consider the operation  table for \(S_3\) in <xref ref="fig-s3-15-4" text="type-global" />.</p>

           <figure xml:id="fig-s3-15-4">
                <caption>Operation table for \(S_3\)
                </caption>
                <image width="80%" source="images/fig-s3-15-4.png">
                    <description>Operation table for \(S_3\)</description>
                </image>
            </figure>
<p>We have shaded in all occurrences of the elements of \(B_3\) in gray. We will call these elements the gray elements and the elements of \(A_3\) the
white ones.</p>

<p>Now consider the process of computing the coset product \(A_3\circ B_3\). The  <q>product</q> is obtained by selecting one white element and one
gray element. Note that white <q>times</q> gray is always gray. Thus, \(A_3\circ B_3\) is well defined. Similarly, the other three possible products
are well defined. The table for the factor group \(S_3/A_3\) is
   \[\begin{array}{c|c}
 \circ  &amp; 
\begin{array}{cc}
 A_3 &amp; B_3 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\hline
 
\begin{array}{c}
 A_{3 } \\
 B_3 \\
\end{array}
 &amp; 
\begin{array}{cc}
 A_3 &amp; B_3 \\
 B_3 &amp; A_3 \\
\end{array}
 \\
\end{array}\]
</p>
<p>Clearly, \(S_3/A_3\) is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).   Notice that \(A_3\) and \(B_3\) are also the right cosets of \(A_3\).  This is significant.</p></example> 

<example xml:id="ex-3-cosets-S3"><title>Cosets of another subgroup of \(S_3\)</title><p>Now let's try the left cosets of \(\langle f_1 \rangle\) in \(S_3\). There are three of them. Will we get a complicated version of \(\mathbb{Z}_3\)? The left cosets are
 \(C_0=\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\), \(C_1= r_1\left\langle f_1\right\rangle = \left\{r_1,f_3\right\}\),  and \(C_2= r_2\left\langle
f_1\right\rangle = \left\{r_2,f_2\right\}\).</p>

<p>The reader might be expecting something to go wrong eventually, and here it is. To determine \(C_1\circ C_2\) we can choose from four pairs of representatives:
<me>
\begin{array}{c}
r_1 \in C_1, r_2\in C_2    \longrightarrow  r_1\circ r_2=i\in C_0\\
r_1\in C_1, f_2\in C_2    \longrightarrow  r_1\circ f_2=f\in C_0\\
f_3\in C_1, r_2\in C_2    \longrightarrow  f_3\circ r_2=f_2\in C_2\\
f_3\in C_1, f_2\in C_2    \longrightarrow  f_3\circ f_2=r_2\in C_2\\
\end{array}
</me>

This time, we don't get the same coset for each pair of representatives. Therefore, the induced operation is not well defined and no factor group
is produced.</p></example> 
<observation><p>
This last example changes our course of action. If we had gotten a factor group from \(\left\{C_0,C_1,C_2\right\}\), we might have
hoped to prove that every collection of left cosets forms a group. Now our question is: How can we determine whether we will get a factor group?
Of course, this question is equivalent to: When is the induced operation well defined? There was only one step in the proof of <xref ref="theorem-coset-operation-well-defined" text="type-global" />, where
we used the fact that <m>G</m> was abelian. We repeat the equations here:
\[a'*b' = \left(a*h_1\right)*\left(b*h_2 \right) = (a*b)*\left(h_1*h_2\right)\]
since <m>G</m> was abelian.</p>

<p>The last step was made possible by the fact that \(h_1*b=b*h_1\). As the proof continued, we used the fact that \(h_1*h_2\) was in <m>H</m> and
so \(a'*b'\) is \((a*b)*h\) for some <m>h</m> in <m>H</m>. All that we really needed in the <q>abelian step</q> was that \(h_1*b = b*(\textrm{something in } H) = b*h_3\).  Then, since <m>H</m> is closed under <m>G</m>'s operation, \(h_3*h_2\) is an element of <m>H</m>. The consequence of this observation is that we define a certain kind of subgroup that guarantees that the inducted operation is well-defined.

<example xml:id="ex-not-normal"><title>A non-normal subgroup</title><p>The right cosets of \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle \leq  S_3\) are \(\left\{i, f_1\right\}\), \(\left\{r_1 f_2 \right\}\),
and \(\left\{r_2 ,f_3\right\}\). These are not the same as the left cosets of \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\). In addition, \(f_2{}^{-1}f_1f_2=f_2f_1f_2=f_3\notin
\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\). Thus, \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\) is not normal. </p></example> 

<p>The improper subgroups \(\{e\}\) and <m>G</m> of any group <m>G</m> are normal subgroups.  \(G/\{e\}\) is isomorphic to <m>G</m>.  All other normal subgroups of a group, if they exist, are called <term>proper normal subgroups</term>.</p> 

<example xml:id="an-is-normal"><p>By Condition b of <xref ref="corollary-normality" text="type-global" />, \(A_n\) is a normal subgroup of \(S_n\) and \(S_n/A_n\)  is isomorphic to \(\mathbb{Z}_2\).</p></example> 

<example xml:id="a5-is-simple"><title>Subgroups of \(A_5\)</title><p>\(A_5\), a group in its own right with 60 elements, has many proper subgroups, but none are normal. Although this could be done by brute force, the number of elements in the group would make the process tedious.  A far more elegant way to approach the verification of this statement is to use the following fact about the cycle structure of permutations.    If \(f\in S_n\) is a permutation with a certain
cycle structure,  \(\sigma _1\sigma _2\cdots \sigma _k\), where the length of \(\sigma _i\) is \(\ell_i\), then for any \(g\in S_n\),   \(g^{-1}\circ
f\circ g\), which is the conjugate of \(f\) by \(g\),  will have a cycle structure with exactly the same cycle lengths.   For example if we take \(f=(1,2,3,4)(5,6)(7,8,9)\in S_9\) and conjugate by \(g=(1,3,5,7,9)\), 
\[\begin{split}
g^{-1}\circ f\circ g &amp; =(1,9,7,5,3)\circ (1,2,3,4)(5,6)(7,8,9)\circ (1,3,5,7,9)\\
	&amp; = (1,4,9,2)(3,6)(5,8,7)\\
\end{split}
\]
</p>
<p>Notice that the condition for normality of a subgroup <m>H</m> of <m>G</m> is that the conjugate of any element of <m>H</m> by an element of <m>G</m> must be remain in <m>H</m>.</p>  

<p>To verify that \(A_5\) has no proper normal subgroups, you can start by cataloging the different cycle structures that occur in \(A_5\) and how many
elements have those structures.   Then consider what happens when you conjugate these different cycle structures with elements of \(A_5\).  
An outline of the process is in the exercises.</p></example>  


<example xml:id="ex-matrix-subgroups-15"><p>Let \(G\) be the set of two by two invertible matrices of real numbers.  That is,
\[G=\left\{\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; b \\
 c &amp; d \\
\end{array}
\right) \mid a,b,c,d\in \mathbb{R}, a d-b c\neq 0\right\}\]
We saw in Chapter 11 that <m>G</m> is a group with matrix multiplication.</p>
<p>This group has many subgroups, but consider just two:
\(H_1=\left\{\left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; a \\
\end{array}
\right)\right| a \neq 0\right\}\)   and \(H_2=\left\{\left.\left(
\begin{array}{cc}
 a &amp; 0 \\
 0 &amp; d \\
\end{array}
\right)\right| a d \neq 0\right\}\). It is fairly simple to apply one of the conditions we have observed for normallity that \(H_1\) a normal subgroup of \(G\), while \(H_2\) is not normal in \(G\).</p></example>

<subsection xml:id="ss-homomorphism"><title>Homomorphisms</title>
<p>Think of the word isomorphism. Chances are, one of the first images that comes to mind is an equation something like
 \[\theta(x * y) = \theta(x) \diamond  \theta(y)\] 
An isomorphism must be a bijection, but the equation above is the algebraic property of an isomorphism. Here we will examine functions that satisfy equations of this type.</p>
<definition xml:id="def-homomorphism"><title>Homomorphism</title><idx>Homomorphism</idx>
<statement><p>Let \([G; *]\) and \([G';\diamond ]\) be groups. \(\theta:G \to G'\) is a homomorphism if \(\theta(x * y) = \theta(x) \diamond  \theta(y)\) for all \(x, y \in G\).</p></statement></definition>
<p>Many homomorphisms are useful since they point out similarities between the two groups (or, on the universal level, two algebraic systems) involved.</p>
<example xml:id="ex-15-4-h1"><title>Decreasing modularity</title><p>Define \(\alpha:\mathbb{Z}_6\to \mathbb{Z}_3\) by \(\alpha(n)=n \textrm{ mod } 3\). Therefore, \(\alpha(0) = 0\), \(\alpha(1) = 1\), \(\alpha(2) = 2\), \(\alpha(3) =1 + 1 + 1=0\), \(\alpha(4) = 1\), and \(\alpha(5) = 2\). If \(n, m \in \mathbb{Z}_6\).  We could actually show that \(\alpha\) is a homomorphism by checking all \(6^2=36\) different cases for the formula 
<mdn><mrow xml:id="ex-15-4-h2">\alpha(n +_6 m) = \alpha(n)+_3\alpha(m)</mrow></mdn>
 but we will use a line of reasoning that generalizes. We have already encountered the Chinese Remainder Theorem, which implies that the function \(\beta: \mathbb{Z}_6\to \mathbb{Z}_3 \times \mathbb{Z}_2\) defined by \(\beta(n)=(n\textrm{ mod } 3, n\textrm{ mod } 2)\).
We need only observe that equating the first coordinates of both sides of the equation 
<mdn><mrow>\beta(n +_6 m) = \beta(n)+_3\beta(m)</mrow></mdn>
gives us precisely the homomorphism property.

then \(\Phi :\mathbb{Z}_2{}^m\to \mathbb{Z}_2{}^n\) defined by

\[\Phi \left(a_1, a_2 , . . . , a _m \right) = \left(a_1, a_2 , . . . , a _m\right)A\]

is a homomorphism. This is true because matrix multiplication is distributive over addition. The only new idea here is that computation is done in
\(\mathbb{Z}_2\).  If \(a=\left(a_1, a_2 , . . . , a _m\right)\) and \(b=\left(b_1, b_2 , . . . , b _m\right)\), \((a + b)A = a A + b A\) is true by basic matrix laws.  Therefore, \(\Phi (a + b) = \Phi (a) + \Phi (b)\).

<exercise number="3"><statement><p>  Show that \(D_4\) has one proper normal subgroup, but that \(\langle (1,4)(2,3)\rangle\) is not normal.</p>
</statement>
<answer><p> \(\langle r\rangle =\left\{i,r,r^2,r^3\right\}\) is a normal subgroup of \(D_4\). To see you could use the table given in the solution of <xref ref="exercise-d4-details" /> of Section 15.3 and verify that  \(a^{-1}h a \in \langle r\rangle\) for all \(a\in D_4\) and \(h\in \langle r\rangle\).   A more efficient
approach is to prove the general theorem that if <m>H</m> is a subgroup <m>G</m> with exactly two distinct left cosets, than <m>H</m> is normal.  
\(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle\) is not a normal subgroup of \(D_4\).  \(\left\langle f_1\right\rangle =\left\{i,f_1\right\}\) and if we choose
\(a = r\) and \(h=f_1\) then \(a^{-1}h a= r^3f_1r=f_2\notin \left\langle f_1\right\rangle\)

\(\alpha\left(a_1,a_2,a_3 \right) = \left(a_1,a_2,a_3 ,a_1+_2 a_2+_2a_3\right)\), and

 \(\beta \left(b_1,b_2,b_3,b_4\right)=b_1+b_2+b_3+b_4\)

    Describe the function \(\beta \circ \alpha\). Is it a homomorphism?</p>
</statement>
<answer><p>  \((\beta \circ  \alpha )\left(a_1,a_2,a_3\right) = 0\)  and so \(\beta \circ \alpha\)  is the trivial homomorphism, but a homomorphism nevertheless.

<exercise number="7"><statement><p>Prove that if <m>G</m> is an abelian group, then \(q(x) = x^2\) defines a homomorphism from <m>G</m> into <m>G</m>.  Is <m>q</m> ever an isomorphism?</p>
</statement>
<answer><p> Let \(x, y \in G\).
	\[\begin{split}
	q(x * y)  &amp;= (x * y)^2\\ 
				&amp; = x*y*x*y \\
				&amp; = x*x*y*y \quad\textrm{ since } G \textrm{ is  abelian}\\
				&amp; =x^2*y^2 \\
				&amp;= q(x)*q(y)
	\end{split}

Hence, <m>q</m> is a homomorphism. In order for <m>q</m> to be an isomorphism, it must be the case that no element other than the identity is its own inverse.
    \[\begin{split}
    x \in \textrm{Ker}(q) &amp; \Leftrightarrow  q (x) = e \\

<answer><p> Proof: Recall that the inverse image of \(H'\) under \(\theta\) is

<p>Closure:   Let \(g_1, g_2\in \theta ^{-1}(H')\), then \(\theta \left(g_1\right),\theta \left(g_2\right)\in H'\).  Since \(H'\) is a subgroup of \(G'\), 
 \[\theta\left(g_1\right)\diamond \theta\left(g_2\right)=\theta\left(g_1*g_2\right)\in H' \Rightarrow  g_1*g_2\in \theta^{-1}(H')\]</p>
